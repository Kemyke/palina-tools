# palinka-tools

My hobby site to support my home distilling process and also support my React learning.
The webapp is available [here](https://palinka.kemy.cc).

## Background

Since it is allowed to distill alcohol at Hungary, I started to make my own palinka.
In this webapp I will collect function which helps during the creation of the distillate.

If you haven't heard of palinka please [check it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka).

## Roadmap

### Available features:
* Dilution calculator: after the destillation doing right the end product contains around 60-80% of alcohol. To make it drinkable it should be diluted. The target 
percentage is around 45-55%. This feature allows you to calculate the amount of water to add to the distillate to lower the alcohol percentage to the desired level.

### Planned features:
* Distillation log: it is useful to record the main parameters of a distillation. Parameters are: the type of fruit you distill, the amount of the mash, the distillation length,
the alcohol percentage at the beginning and at the end and the amount of distillate you get. 
* Inventory: helps tp register all the palinka you have it in your stock. It is also helps when the authorities ask for a detailed information how much palinka did you produce each year.
